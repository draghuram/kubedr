 Configuration
===============

Master nodes
============

Before backups are run, make sure that one or more master nodes has
a label identifying them (if not already present). Some clusters are
set up with *node-role.kubernetes.io/master* label on the master
nodes. If this is the case, nothing more needs to be done. If this
label is not present, create it.

If it is not possible to use the above name for label, choose any name
and pass that name in policy options (as described below).

S3 end point
============

Before defining and running backups, you need to configure a S3 end
point that acts as target for the backups.

To define the S3 target, you need to create a custom resource called
``BackupLocation``.

A sample resource:

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: kubedr.catalogicsoftware.com/v1alpha1
  kind: BackupLocation
  metadata:
    name: remote-minio
  spec:
    url: http://10.96.57.3:9000
    bucketName: testbucket
    credentials: minio-creds

name
    Logical name of the resource.

url
    S3 end point

bucketName
    Name of the S3 bucket. It will be created if it doesn't exist.

credentials
    Name of the Kubernetes "secret" resource containing S3
    credentials.

    The secret should contain three pieces of information. Here is the
    description of each item in the secret and the key with which they
    should be created.

    * S3 access key ("access_key")
    * S3 secret key ("secret_key")
    * Password to be used to encrypt backups ("restic_repo_password").

    Here is one way to create such a secret:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ echo -n 'sample_access_key' > access_key
      $ echo -n 'sample_secret_key' > secret_key
      $ echo -n 'sample_restic_repo_password' > restic_repo_password

      $ kubectl -n kubedr-system create secret generic minio-creds \
          --from-file=access_key --from-file=secret_key \
          --from-file restic_repo_password

    Note that the secret must be created in the namespace
    *kubedr-system*.

Assuming you defined the ``BackupLocation`` resource in a file called
``backuplocation.yaml``, create the resource by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl -n kubedr-system apply -f backuplocation.yaml

At this time, *Kubedr* will initialize a backup repository at the
configured bucket (creating the bucket if necessary). To verify that
initialization is successful, run the following command and ensure
that "initStatus" is "Completed".

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl -n kubedr-system get backuplocations <BACKUP_LOCATION_NAME>
